## Make a rwd that enable steering down to 0mph for honda CR-V & civic

### Supported car models
- CR-V 5G (Tested by joe1)
- Civic (eps motor part number 39990-TBA), Untested.
- Civic (eps motor part number 39990-TEA), Untested.

- "00 28" is the lowest vehicle speed (in kph) that eps can accept steering request at. 
- So the limitation can be removed by changing "00 28" to "00 00", make a rwd patch, flash it to the car. 

### The rwd patch format
- Both CR-V and civic use [rwd format 0x5A](https://github.com/gregjhogan/rwd-xray/blob/master/format/x5a.py)
- Most rwd params can be found by parsing stock rwd using [rwd-xray.py](https://github.com/gregjhogan/rwd-xray/blob/master/rwd-xray.py), except the encryption algorithm.
- The code in rwd is encrypted using a byte substitution algo, firmware will decrypt the code inplace.
- The encryption algorithm may vary for every honda model.

### How we found the encryption algorithm for civic 39990-TBA
- We have a working homemade CR-V rwd and we also have the corresponding full firmware bin dumped from the eps motor.
- We extracted encrypted code block from the rwd and save it to file.
- We also extract the original code from the full fw bin and save to to file (from offset 0x4000 to 0x6C000).
- Then we tried building a byte-to-byte map from these two files using [this tool](https://github.com/nanamiwang/rwd-xray/blob/master/tools/build-byte-lookup-table.py).
```
python3 build-byte-lookup-table.py --input_bin ~/data/crv_5g_stock.bin --input_enc ~/data/2017-honda-crv-eps.enc
```
- We got a one-to-one map between encrypted and decrypted code, so apparently it is a correct byte lookup table for encryption. [The table here](https://github.com/nanamiwang/rwd-xray/blob/80600d071dc580db727a96c9b83c9615058bcf7b/tools/bin_to_rwd.py#L16)
- We have a full eps firmware bin dumped from civic 39990-TBA, also the corresponding stock rwd from i-HDS 1.004 installation package (You can find the package by googling) 
- So we tried decrypting the code from civic rwd using the CR-V lookup table, it worked, the decrypted code totally match with the civic full firmware bin. So we have a conclusion that civic uses the same encryption algo as CR-V.

### Patch the code and make the rwd
- Patch the full firmware bin
  - A hex editor is ok for this job
  - Open the CR-V or civic full firmware bin
  - Find "00 28 01 90" in the bin, modify "28" to "00", then save it.
- Convert the bin to rwd using [bin_to_rwd.py](https://github.com/nanamiwang/rwd-xray/blob/master/tools/bin_to_rwd.py)
- CR-V

### Verify the rwd, make sure we are making the correct modifications
- Compare our homemade rwd with the stock rwd using a hex editor
  - The speed low byte should be changed from 0x28 to 0x0 correctly
![](https://i.ibb.co/H76yd0F/image.png)
```
>>> hex(decrypt_lookup_table[0x71])
'0x0'
>>> hex(decrypt_lookup_table[0x10])
'0x28'
```
  - The block checksum, padded block checksum, rwd file checksum are also updated correctly.

### How to test the rwd on car
- Try the stock rwd first, flash it to your car. If it is working, your car is compatible with the 0 steering rwd.
- Then try flashing the homemade 0 steering rwd.
- If the homemade rwd bricks the eps, use stock rwd to do recovery.
- <b>Caution! Improper flashing may damage the eps. I don't have civic, so I never test it on car. Use it at your own risk.</b>
